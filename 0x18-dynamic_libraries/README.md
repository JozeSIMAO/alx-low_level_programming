#0x18. C - Dynamic libraries

#A dynamic library, also known as a shared library, is a type of code library used in software development. It contains reusable code and resources that multiple programs or applications can use simultaneously. The term "dynamic" refers to the fact that the library is linked to the executable code of a program at runtime, rather than being compiled directly into the program's code.
