# 0x14. C - Bit manipulation


## Description

- Bit manipulation is the act of algorithmically manipulating bits or other pieces of data shorter than a word. Bit manipulation is something that has constant time complexity. This tutorial explains the basics and why Bitwise operators are used in programming.

Introduction
Bit manipulation is the process of applying logical operations on a sequence of bits to achieve a required result. It is an act of algorithmically manipulating bits or other pieces of data shorter than a word.

Computer programming tasks that require bit manipulation include:

Low-level device control
Error detection and correction algorithms
Data compression
Encryption algorithms
Optimization
